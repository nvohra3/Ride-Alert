# Ride-Alert
What is it?
The purpose of this app is to notify a friend (via a simple text message) that you're almost at their location when you're giving them a ride

Why?
This is used to prevent that situation where you're sitting outside your friend's house for 10 minutes waiting for them to come outside when they could have been ready a little quicker. Also, hopefully people won't be stupid and try to text their while driving before reaching their friend's location. 

How it works: If you have an address in your contacts book for the a contact, then an "alert" will be set up and the contact will get a text message when you're "x" miles from their address.  If you don't have an address for that contact, then you have the option have a text message sent to the contact asking for his/her address. When the contact responds with an address, the app will read the text message containing your friend's address and set up the alert automatically. After that, the contact will then receive a text message as expected when you're "x" miles away.  You can view your active alerts by going to the second tab on the home screen.

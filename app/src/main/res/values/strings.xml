    <string name="app_description">The purpose of this app is to notify a somebody that you\'re almost
        at their location when you\'re giving them a ride. This is used to prevent that situation
        where you\'re sitting outside their house for 10 minutes waiting for them to come outside.
        \n\nHow it works: Select a contact by clicking the button below. If you have an address in
        your contacts book for the selected contact, then an "alert" will be set up and the contact
        will get a text message when you\'re \"x\" miles from their address.  If you don\'t have an
        address for that contact, then you have the option have a text message sent to the contact
        asking for his/her address. When the contact responds with an address, the alert will
        automatically be set up and he/she will receive a text message as expected when you\'re
        \"x\" miles away.</string>

    <string name="app_description">The purpose of this app is to notify a friend that you\'re almost
        at their location when you\'re giving them a ride. This is used to prevent that situation
        where you\'re sitting outside their house for 10 minutes waiting for them to come outside.
        \nHow it works: Select a contact by clicking the button below. If you have an address in your
        contacts book for the selected contact, then an "alert" will be set up and the contact will
        get a text message when you\'re \"x\" miles from their address.  If you don\'t have an address
        for that contact, then you have the option have a text message sent to the contact asking for
        his/her address. When the contact responds with an address, the alert will automatically be
        set up and he/she will receive a text message as expected when you\'re \"x\" miles away.</string>
